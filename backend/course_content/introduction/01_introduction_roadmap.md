# Module 1: Introduction and Roadmap  

Welcome to the course! This module establishes the foundational roadmap for your learning journey. Below are key resources to visualize and reinforce your understanding of structured learning paths.  

## Why Follow a Roadmap?  
A clear learning roadmap provides direction, breaks complex topics into manageable milestones, and maintains motivation throughout your educational journey.  

### Learning Path Visualization  
The following example illustrates how structured daily milestones simplify mastering technical subjects like programming:
