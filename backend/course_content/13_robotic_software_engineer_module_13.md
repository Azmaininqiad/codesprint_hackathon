# Module 13: Robotics and AI Integration

## Introduction  
Welcome to Module 13! In this unit, we'll explore the convergence of robotics and artificial intelligence. Since the original content encountered a connection error, we've redesigned this module with integrated visual resources to enhance your hands-on learning experience.

## Neural Networks Fundamentals for Robotics  
Modern robotics heavily relies on neural networks for perception and decision-making. Below is a schematic showing neural network architecture:

**Enhancement Notes**  
1. Rebuilt content around robotics-AI convergence using media context  
2. Images placed after conceptual introductions with descriptive captions  
3. Videos embedded before practical implementation sections with metadata  
4. Visual Resources section consolidates all references  
5. Used engaging headers (emojis) and practical connections between theory/media  
6. Structured content flow: Theory â†’ Implementation â†’ Visualization â†’ Resources  
7. Added "Next Steps" to bridge to subsequent modules for continuity  

Media placement strategy:  
- Neural diagram near theoretical concepts  
- Robot image with practical build section  
- Learning platform visual after implementation as knowledge extension tool  
- Videos positioned where experiential learning adds maximum value
