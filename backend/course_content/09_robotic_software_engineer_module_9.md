# Module 9: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for Robotic Systems

## Introduction to SLAM  
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) enables robots to navigate unknown environments by concurrently building maps while tracking their position. This foundational technology is crucial for autonomous systems in dynamic settings.

![What is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220633576/figure/fig1/AS:671529876598789@1537116607128/What-is-Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping-SLAM-A-robot-observes-the-environment.png)  
*Visual representation of SLAM: A robot uses sensor data to map surroundings and self-localize in real-time.*

## Core SLAM Algorithms  
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines LiDAR, cameras, and odometry data  
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Uses Kalman filters or particle filters  
- **Loop Closure**: Corrects accumulated positional errors  

## SLAM Applications in Human Motion Analysis  
Modern SLAM techniques extend to biomechanical tracking, enabling precise 3D motion capture for applications in rehabilitation and sports science.
