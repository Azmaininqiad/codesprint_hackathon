# Module 5: Robotic Software Fundamentals with ROS  
*Beginner Level*  
**Learning Objective**: Understand core concepts of robot software engineering using ROS (Robot Operating System), including nodes, topics, and basic communication patterns.  
**Approximate Reading Time**: 12 minutes

## Introduction  
Welcome to the heart of robot software engineering! In this module, we'll explore the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** ‚Äì the industry-standard framework for building robotic systems. Unlike traditional operating systems, ROS provides tools and libraries to handle hardware abstraction, device drivers, and inter-process communication. By the end, you'll create your first ROS nodes and understand how robots communicate internally.

## 5.1: ROS Core Concepts  

### What is ROS?  
ROS is a **meta-operating system** that provides:  
- **Middleware** for process communication  
- **Hardware abstraction** for sensors/actuators  
- **Package management** for code organization  
- **Visualization tools** (RVIZ, rqt)  

### Key Terminology:  
- **Nodes**: Independent processes performing computations (e.g., sensor driver, navigation algorithm)  
- **Topics**: Communication channels for data streams (e.g., /camera_feed, /motor_commands)  
- **Messages**: Data structures transmitted via topics (defined in `.msg` files)  
- **Master**: Central registry that coordinates node connections  

### ROS Workspace Setup  
All ROS code lives in a **workspace**. Create yours:  
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src  
cd ~/catkin_ws/  
catkin_make  # Builds the workspace  
source devel/setup.bash  # Activates environment  
```  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always run `source devel/setup.bash` when opening new terminals!

## 5.2: Creating Your First ROS Node  
A node is an executable that performs a specific task. Let's make a Python node that publishes sensor data.  

### Step-by-Step: Temperature Publisher  
1. **Create package** in your workspace:  
```bash 
cd ~/catkin_ws/src  
catkin_create_pkg sensor_nodes rospy std_msgs  
```  

2. **Write node** (`sensor_publisher.py`):  
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3  
import rospy  
from std_msgs.msg import Float32  

def publish_temperature():  
    rospy.init_node('temp_sensor')  
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/temperature', Float32, queue_size=10)  
    rate = rospy.Rate(1)  # 1Hz update  
    
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():  
        temp = 25.0 + (0.1 * rospy.Time.now().to_sec())  # Simulated data  
        pub.publish(temp)  
        rospy.loginfo(f"Published: {temp}¬∞C")  
        rate.sleep()  

if __name__ == '__main__':  
    try:  
        publish_temperature()  
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:  
        pass  
```  

3. **Make executable**:  
```bash  
chmod +x sensor_publisher.py  
```  

4. **Run**:  
```bash  
roscore &  # Start ROS master  
rosrun sensor_nodes sensor_publisher.py  
```

## 5.3: ROS Topic Communication  

### Publisher-Subscriber Pattern  
Nodes communicate **asynchronously** via topics:  
- **Publisher**: Sends messages to a topic  
- **Subscriber**: Receives messages from a topic  

### Creating a Subscriber Node  
Let's make a node that listens to our temperature data:  

```python  
#!/usr/bin/env python3  
import rospy  
from std_msgs.msg import Float32  

def callback(msg):  
    rospy.loginfo(f"Current temperature: {msg.data}¬∞C")  

def temp_subscriber():  
    rospy.init_node('temp_monitor')  
    rospy.Subscriber('/temperature', Float32, callback)  
    rospy.spin()  # Keep node running  

if __name__ == '__main__':  
    temp_subscriber()  
```  

### Debugging Tools  
- **View active topics**: `rostopic list`  
- **Inspect messages**: `rostopic echo /temperature`  
- **View node connections**: `rqt_graph`  

### Real-World Analogy  
Think of ROS topics like **radio channels**:  
- Publisher = Radio station (broadcasts on frequency)  
- Subscriber = Radio listener (tuned to frequency)  
- Master = FCC (coordinates frequencies)

*Control systems (like robotics) often use feedback loops ‚Äì similar to how ROS nodes exchange data for real-time adjustments*

### Real-World Application: Automotive Systems  
Modern vehicles use distributed communication systems similar to ROS:

## Key Takeaways  
‚úÖ ROS uses a **node-based architecture** for modular design  
‚úÖ **Topics** enable loose coupling between components  
‚úÖ All communication is **message-driven** via defined data types  
‚úÖ Workspace setup (`catkin_make`) is foundational  
‚úÖ `rostopic` and `rqt` are essential debugging tools

## Practical Exercises  
1. Modify the publisher to send data at 5Hz instead of 1Hz  
2. Create a node that subscribes to `/temperature` and:  
   - Prints "ALARM" if temperature > 28¬∞C  
   - Calculates average temperature every 10 readings  
3. Use `rostopic hz /temperature` to verify publish rate  
4. Define a custom message type for "RoomStatus" containing:  
   - Temperature (float32)  
   - Humidity (float32)  
   - Occupancy (bool)

## Summary  
In this module, you've taken the first critical steps in robotic software engineering:  
1. Understood ROS core concepts (nodes, topics, messages)  
2. Created functional publisher/subscriber nodes  
3. Used ROS command-line tools to debug systems  
4. Simulated sensor data flow between components  

This pattern forms the **backbone of all ROS systems** ‚Äì from industrial robots to self-driving cars. Remember: great roboticists aren't just hardware experts; they're communication architects!
