*Advanced theoretical concepts form the backbone of robotic innovation*  

### 1. Real-Time Systems & ROS 2  
Robotic systems demand deterministic timing. Learn to leverage **ROS 2’s real-time capabilities**:  
```cpp
// Example: Real-time node with QoS profiles
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"

class RealTimeNode : public rclcpp::Node {
public:
  RealTimeNode() : Node("realtime_node") {
    auto qos = rclcpp::QoS(rclcpp::KeepLast(10)).reliable();
    publisher_ = create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>("topic", qos);
    // Add real-time executor configuration here
  }
};
```

### 2. Advanced Perception Pipelines  
- **3D LiDAR SLAM**: Combine Point Cloud Library (PCL) with deep learning for dynamic object filtering.  
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Kalman Filters + Bayesian networks for redundancy in autonomous vehicles.  

### 3. AI Integration

*Classification of AI techniques for robotic systems*  

Embed reinforcement learning (RL) into control systems:  
```python
# PPO-based robotic arm control using Stable Baselines3
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
env = RoboticArmEnv()
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, n_steps=2048)
model.learn(total_timesteps=1e6)
```

### 4. Security & Ethics  
- **OODA Loop** (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) for threat mitigation  
- GDPR/ISO 10218 compliance in human-robot interaction

## Tutorial: Multi-Robot Coordination System  
**Step 1:** Setup ROS 2 Galactic with Gazebo 11  
```bash
sudo apt install ros-galactic-desktop gazebo11
```

**Step 2:** Implement task allocation via Auction Protocol  
```python
# auction_bot.py
def bid_callback(task):
    computational_cost = calculate_cost(task)
    return (self.id, computational_cost)
```

**Step 3:** Deploy fault detection using heartbeat monitoring:  
```cpp
// heartbeart_monitor.cpp
if (last_msg_time > ROS_TIME_NOW() - TIMEOUT) {
  trigger_fallback_controller();
}
```
