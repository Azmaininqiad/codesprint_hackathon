# MATLAB Module 5: Data Analysis Fundamentals  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Estimated Reading Time**: 12 minutes  

## Introduction  
Welcome to Module 5! This module focuses on essential data analysis techniques in MATLAB. You'll learn to import/export data, perform statistical operations, and create basic curve fits—skills crucial for analyzing experimental results or datasets. By the end, you'll manipulate CSV files, calculate statistics, and model linear trends.

## Topic 5.1: Importing and Exporting Data  
### Why This Matters  
Real-world data often resides in external files. MATLAB provides tools to seamlessly integrate this data into your workflow.  

### Key Concepts  
- **readmatrix()**: Imports numeric data from files (CSV, Excel).  
- **writematrix()**: Exports MATLAB variables to files.  
- **Data Types**: MATLAB auto-converts numbers; text requires `readtable()`.  

### Step-by-Step Tutorial  
1. **Import a CSV File**:  
   ```matlab
   % Save this data as "sensor_data.csv":  
   % 1, 23.5  
   % 2, 24.1  
   % 3, 22.9  
   data = readmatrix('sensor_data.csv');  
   disp(data);  
   ```  
   Output:  
   ```  
   1    23.5  
   2    24.1  
   3    22.9  
   ```  

2. **Export to Excel**:  
   ```matlab
   results = [10, 20; 30, 40];  
   writematrix(results, 'output.xlsx');  
   ```  

### Common Pitfalls  
- File paths: Use full paths (`C:/folder/file.csv`) or ensure files are in MATLAB’s current folder.

## Topic 5.2: Basic Statistical Operations  
### Core Principles  
MATLAB simplifies statistics with built-in functions:  
- **mean()**, **median()**, **std()** (standard deviation), and **min()**/**max()**.  

### Practical Example  
Analyze temperature data:  
```matlab
temps = [23.5, 24.1, 22.9, 25.3, 21.7];  
avg_temp = mean(temps);  
std_dev = std(temps);  
fprintf('Average: %.2f°C\nStandard Deviation: %.2f', avg_temp, std_dev);  
```  
Output:  
```  
Average: 23.50°C  
Standard Deviation: 1.34  
```  

### Grouped Data Analysis  
```matlab
% Matrix columns = different sensors  
sensor_data = [  
    23.5, 24.0;  
    24.1, 23.8;  
    22.9, 24.2  
];  
column_means = mean(sensor_data); % Output: [23.50, 23.67]  
```

## Topic 5.3: Curve Fitting Basics  
### What is Curve Fitting?  
Finding a mathematical model that best describes data trends (e.g., linear, polynomial).  

### Polynomial Fit Tutorial  
Fit a line to (x,y) data:  
```matlab
x = [1, 2, 3, 4];  
y = [2.1, 3.9, 6.2, 8.1];  
p = polyfit(x, y, 1); % 1 = linear fit  
slope = p(1);  
intercept = p(2);  
fprintf('Equation: y = %.2fx + %.2f', slope, intercept);  
```  
Output:  
```  
Equation: y = 2.00x + 0.05  
```  

### Visualize the Fit  
```matlab
plot(x, y, 'ko', 'MarkerSize', 8);  
hold on;  
y_fit = polyval(p, x);  
plot(x, y_fit, 'r-');  
legend('Data', 'Linear Fit');  
xlabel('Time (s)');  
ylabel('Distance (m)');  
```

## Key Takeaways  
1. Use **`readmatrix()`**/`writematrix()` for numeric data I/O.  
2. Apply **`mean()`**, **`std()`** for quick statistics.  
3. Create trendlines with **`polyfit()`** for analysis.  
4. Always verify paths when accessing files.  

## Practice Exercises  
1. Import [`sales_data.csv`](https://example.com/sales_data.csv) and compute total sales.  
   ```csv  
   Month,Revenue  
   Jan,12000  
   Feb,15000  
   ```  
2. Calculate the variance (`var()`) of `[5, 7, 3, 9, 2]`.  
3. Fit a quadratic curve (degree=2) to:  
   ```matlab
   x = [0, 1, 2, 3];  
   y = [1, 4, 9, 16];  
   ```
